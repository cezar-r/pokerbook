# Poker Bookie Mobile App

- This is an app that can be used by poker players to keep track of their winnings over time. This app provides a friendly user interface that makes it easy for users to upload new games and view their stats in a meaningful way. We do this by providing a graph of the players earnings over time, as well as providing insights such as winrate per hour, win/loss percentage, and total time played. We also shows these stats divided into locations and stakes.

- Below are some screenshots of the app and how it can be used.
